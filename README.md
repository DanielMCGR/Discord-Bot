# Kebbot - The Discord Bot
Discord Bot used in private servers, created with the Java Discord API (JDA).
Some commands and information have been removed for safety/private reasons.
Link to JDA: https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA

Besides the commands found in the CommandList class, the bot also has interaction with Yeelight compatible devices and implements one of my projects that helps automate some tasks and give information to Genshin Impapct (video game) players.

NEW: The bot now also has implemented Chess and CodeWords (aka CodeNames) games that are fully playable!
